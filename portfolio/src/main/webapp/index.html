                I experienced the Google Computer Science Summer Institute where I learned software engineering techniques from Google Engineers, including APIs, front-end and back-end development, 
                server management, and source code management through languages such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS at the Google Office in New York, New York.

            <p>
                I experienced the CS 197 AI Research Section as a part of the National Science Foundation funded Computing Research Association Early Research Scholars Program and conducted 
                research under the supervision of Prof. Michael Bernstein and Ph.D. student Daniel Kang related to Barrage of Random Transforms for Adversarial Robust Defense in computer vision 
                models.

                I experienced the Google Student Training in Engineering Program, a 12-week internship for first and second-year undergraduate students, offering the opportunity to bridge the gap
                 between academic understanding and practical professional experience by working on a software project alongside other interns and full-time Google Software Engineers.
